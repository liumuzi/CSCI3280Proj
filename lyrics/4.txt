Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To open arms of the sea yeah
Lonely river sigh wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home wait for me.
Oh, my, love, my darling I've hungered for
Your touch, a long lonely time
And time goes by, so slowly and time
Can do so much, are you still mine
I need your love,
I oh I need your love,
God speed your love to me.
