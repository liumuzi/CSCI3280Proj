When I need you 
Just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you 
Its only a heart beat away
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love 
I never knew there was so much love 
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in 
Between us 
A telephone can't take the place of your 
Smile
But you know I won't be traveling 
Forever 
Its cold out but hold out and do like I do 
When I need you
Just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you babe 
Its only a heartbeat away 
It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear 
But you know I won't be traveling a 
Lifetime 
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do
Oh I need you 
When I need you 
I hold out my hands and I touch love 
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day 
When I need you 
Just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you
Its only a heart beat away
